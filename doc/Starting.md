# ðŸ’ª Starting

Creating a new project is usually a headache to restore configurations that you would have defined in another application.

In order to design your first `Discord Factory` project, please use the following command according to your package manager:
```bash
npm init factory-app <projectName> <yaml|json>
# or
yarn factory-app <projectName> <yaml|json>
```

That's it !

It's up to you !
