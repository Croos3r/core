# ðŸ§¡ Core-next
The `@discord-factory/core-next` module is the core project of the Discord Factory framework.
It handles everything related to project initialization, slash command registration within Discord and the instantiation of the Discord client.

If you want to install the framework, don't just download the `@discord-factory/core-next` package as this fully exploits a previously defined framework.
